 # The Challenge
 - To Demonstrate how Azure Blockchain can be used to make Elections, referendum, and polls more secure, reliable, and transparent.

 # Overview
  An Android and Web-based Application with Azure Blockchain Database of the number of people around the whole of India. As part of the Digital India Initiative, the Government of India is offering Datasets on Open Government Data Platform India. So we are using this dataset. And for this, we are using Azure Blockchain technologies provided by Microsoft to gain high security and fast speed through the network.
  
  # Features And Ideation
  - We are working on the topic ***Elections, referenda, and polls Management System*** 
  
  - **BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE**
    
  - Our Idea is to design an app for Android and host a Website using Microsoft dependencies and some more and going to show the count       of how many people around are there around whole India and to easily vote their political leaders and on their own will.

  - Voting will be via fingerprint authentication and/or Pin, Aadhaar API usage and two-step authentication.
 
  - Map marking facilities and displaying of political leaders with their previous works
 
  - Along with that one can rate their political leaders and share reviews.
 
  - Everyone would have a new profile management system with password protected.
 
  - Auto registration for voter ID after 18+ age and remove all sorts of updating problems.
 
  - Avoid multiple registrations on same aadhaar.
  
  - Avoid Screen Recording and taking screenshots.
  
  - Anonymous rartings and ppublic chat rooms will be there
  
  - Map integration will be there for displaying political leaders are from which place
  
  - App will display that which political leaders has done what and with what ratings.
  
  - Completely Anonymous voting
  
  - Also Results will be with seconds just after the voting.
  
  - Also it will be decided that you have to be in a particular radius of police station to give vote to avoid forcefully vote or scams.
  
  - Pin system to check final authentic user for voting 
  
  - Snapping picture finally to check wether it is not bots 
  
  - Avoid Running app in Rooted device
 
  - Avoid Running it in Emulators or if it is under debugging mode
  
  - Every thing saved on database will be Encrypted via AESencryption with a unique security key
  
  - App unlocks with a fingerprint authentication
  
  - Every voter has a unique pin
  
  - In app email sender to send otps 

  - Added SHA256 one way ecryption with a unique key for final check that he has voted
  
  - User will be mailed with final voter to check someone else hasnot voted
# Usage
 - Every family should have atleast one admin , where everyone can register themselves.
 - Every person needs to register themselves to give vote.
 - Voter has to remember a unique pin.
 - At the time of registeration the user should have aadhaar to scan.
