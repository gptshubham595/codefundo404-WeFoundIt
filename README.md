 # The Challenge
  To Demonstrate how Azure Blockchain can be used to make Elections, referendum, and polls more secure, reliable, and transparent.

 # Overview
  An Android and Web-based Application with Azure Blockchain Database of the number of people around the whole of India. As part of the Digital India Initiative, the Government of India is offering Datasets on Open Government Data Platform India. So we are using this dataset. And for this, we are using Azure Blockchain technologies provided by Microsoft to gain high security and fast speed through the network.
  
  # Features And Ideation
  -We are working on the topic ***Elections, referenda, and polls Management System***
  
  -Android app and Website that will be open for three types of people:
    1)  Political Leaders
    2)  Individual
    3)  Admin Panel
    
 -Our Idea is to design an app for Android and host a Website using Microsoft dependencies and some more and going to show the count of   how many people around are there around whole India and to easily vote their political leaders and on their own will.

 -Voting will be via fingerprint authentication and/or Pin, Aadhaar API usage and two-step authentication.
 
 -Map marking facilities and displaying of political leaders with their previous works
 
 -Along with that one can rate their political leaders and share reviews.
 
 -Everyone would have a new profile management system with password protected.
 
 -Auto registration for voter ID after 18+ age and remove all sorts of updating problems.
 
 -Avoid multiple registrations on same aadhaar.
